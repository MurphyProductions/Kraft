# Kraft
A text based strategy Game
At first your in a vilagge with pretty much nothing. Then you start to expand your territory. Until you become a city with markets, casinos, lumberyards, mining facilitys, and much more. Do you have what it takes to become the next leader of the largets countrys in the world? Then start building!


This game took me awhile to make. Like a few weeks. I had been working on it when ever I could. So now it is really cool.
I am thinking about making a server for it, and having alot of people compete against each other. So, stay tuned!
I got insperation on making this game to what it is now, by one of the games I had made before.  https://murphyproductions.github.io/agame/
And by one of my best friends. Samuel.
Anyways, before when I started making it, I had just wanted to kill time with it, then I decided that it could be much more. So 
I mena right now it isnt much but before, it was only, lumber yards, mineing facilitys and houses. But Now its got way more than I had hoped for.
